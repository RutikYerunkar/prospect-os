# Groundwork — Progress

Living state. Read this before touching anything — it tells you what's done, what's next, and what
not to re-litigate. Updated and committed at every checkpoint boundary (see
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §30 for the checkpoint protocol).

## Current checkpoint

**B — Core engine.** Status: **complete**, ready to stop per the checkpoint protocol.

Next session should start **Checkpoint C — API / SSE** (see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §30), after
reading `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and this file.

## What was built

**Models** (`apps/api/groundwork/models/`)
- `enums.py` — `Mode`, `EvidenceOrigin`, `SignalType`, `ContactVerification`, `ProspectStage`,
  `ProspectStatus`, `ReviewVerdict`, `RunStatus`, `StepStatus`.
- `schemas.py` — every domain Pydantic model (`PlaySpec`, `CompanySeed`, `Evidence`, `ResearchFacts`
  and its fact types, `Signal`, `ICPScore`/`DimensionScore`/`ScoreModifier`, `Contact`,
  `OutreachDraft`/`ClaimMapEntry`, `ReviewCheck`/`ReviewResult`, `ProspectOutcome`). `Evidence` carries
  the §12 provenance `model_validator`: only `LIVE_FETCH` may carry an `http(s)` `source_url`; every
  other origin is rejected if it tries to.
- `llm_io.py` — `ResearchExtractionOutput`, `PersonalizationOutput`, `ScoreExplanationOutput` (the
  three structured-output shapes the demo LLM actually returns).
- `tables.py` — the full SQLAlchemy schema from §20 (`plays`, `runs`, `companies`, `prospects`,
  `evidence`, `signals`, `icp_scores`, `contacts`, `outreach_drafts`, `review_results`, `approvals`,
  `agent_tasks`, `run_events`). `create_all()` only, no Alembic (as planned for this stage).

**Domain** (`apps/api/groundwork/domain/` — pure, zero I/O, verified by `grep` to import only from
`models/`)
- `dedupe.py` — domain/name normalization, dedupe key (domain-first, name fallback).
- `grounding.py` — token-overlap claim verification against an evidence snippet.
- `scoring.py` — the eight-dimension weighted ICP rubric exactly per §13, including the evidence gate,
  the hard disqualifier modifier, and `confidence = supported/total`. `industry_fit`/`size_fit` are
  treated as always-supported structural facts (from `CompanySeed`, not a claim needing evidence); the
  other six dimensions are gated on `evidence_ids` being non-empty.
- `review.py` — all seven deterministic checks (`claim_grounding`, `no_fabricated_contact`,
  `cross_prospect_leak`, `no_placeholders`, `duplicate_account`, `score_support`,
  `confidence_floor`) and the verdict rule (any hard fail → `FAIL`; else any soft fail →
  `NEEDS_REVIEW`; else `PASS`).

**Providers** (`apps/api/groundwork/providers/`)
- `base.py` — `LLMProvider`/`SearchProvider` Protocols, `ProviderBundle`, `PromptEnvelope`,
  `ProviderTimeout`/`ProviderUnavailable`/`SchemaViolation`, and `make_ctx_key`/`parse_ctx_key`/
  `stable_seed`. **Deviation from the plan's illustrative snippet:** seeded jitter uses a sha256-based
  `stable_seed()` instead of Python's builtin `hash()`, because `hash()` on strings is
  process-salted and would silently break the "a run is replayable by seed" claim.
  **Minor signature deviation:** `SearchProvider.fetch_sources` takes an extra `ctx_key` keyword
  (needed to scope scripted-failure attempt counting and jitter to one `(run_id, prospect_id,
  step)`), since the plan's §11 snippet was explicitly "shape, not final code."
- `demo/fixtures.py` — typed loader for the YAML fixture pack.
- `demo/demo_search.py`, `demo/demo_llm.py` — Demo Mode implementations. Fixture-derived structured
  output for research extraction; deterministic templating (from `ctx`-only envelope metadata, never
  the fixture pack) for personalization and the score explanation. Seeded jitter and
  fixture-configured scripted retry/failure are both generic over any step name a fixture names, not
  hardcoded to "research".
- `registry.py` — `build_provider_bundle(mode, seed, fixture_pack)`; raises `NotImplementedError` for
  `Mode.LIVE` (P1, not built).

**Engine** (`apps/api/groundwork/engine/` — core machinery ~484 LOC incl. docstrings; the ~400 LOC
guidance in §33 was aimed at preventing a generic DAG/plugin framework, which this isn't — it's a
fixed 7-step list, a retry/timeout wrapper, and a semaphore-bounded fan-out)
- `context.py` — `ProspectContext`, the isolation boundary. Every mutable field lives here; nothing
  else accumulates cross-prospect state. Carries read-only `other_dedupe_keys`/
  `other_company_identifiers` (names/domains only, never evidence/facts/scores) so the
  `cross_prospect_leak` and `duplicate_account` checks have something to check without breaking
  isolation.
- `step.py` — `Step`/`StepResult`. One `agent_tasks` row per attempt, exponential backoff + jitter
  (0.4s/0.8s/1.6s per §10), idempotency via `TraceRecorder.has_succeeded`, `optional` steps degrade
  instead of failing the prospect.
- `pipeline.py` — `Pipeline` with a real Kahn's-algorithm `topological_order()` over `depends_on` (not
  just an assumed-correct fixed list), plus `build_prospect_pipeline()` wiring Research → Signals →
  Enrich → Score → Contact → Personalize → Review. Research has `max_retries=2`; Contact and
  Personalize are `optional=True`.
- `runner.py` — `discover_and_dedupe()` (sequential, cheap) + `execute_run()`: global
  `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_prospects)`, one coroutine per prospect,
  `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`, a run-level wall-clock watchdog
  (`asyncio.wait_for` around the gather) that marks any still-running prospect `TIMED_OUT` on
  expiry. Final prospect status is derived as: `DUPLICATE` (pre-pipeline) → `FAILED` (unhandled
  exception) → `REJECTED` (score disqualified, or review verdict `FAIL`) → `NEEDS_REVIEW` (review
  verdict `NEEDS_REVIEW`) → `PASS`.
- `steps/` — `research.py` (fetch sources → `Evidence` + LLM-extracted `ResearchFacts`, naive
  `source_ref → evidence_id` linking only), `signals.py` (the deterministic verifier half of the §9
  Hybrid design — demotes any fact whose claim doesn't token-overlap its cited evidence's snippet by
  clearing its `evidence_ids`, and always records a `Signal` either way), `enrich.py` (resolves a
  preliminary `Contact` from grounded leadership facts — needed before Score, since
  `persona_availability` is one of its dimensions, even though Contact is later in the pipeline order),
  `score.py` (calls `domain/scoring.py`, then one LLM call that writes only `explanation` from the
  finished numbers), `contact.py` (optional finalize/fallback), `personalize.py` (skipped, never
  fabricated, when `contact.verification == UNAVAILABLE`; envelope built only from this prospect's own
  grounded signals), `review.py` (calls `domain/review.py`).

**Observability** (`apps/api/groundwork/observability/`)
- `trace.py` — `TraceRecorder`, pre-bound to `(run_id, prospect_id)`, wraps `TaskRepository`.
- `events.py` — `EventEmitter`, pre-bound to `run_id`, wraps `EventRepository`. Event types emitted:
  `prospect.discovered`, `prospect.stage_changed`, `step.started`, `step.completed`, `step.retrying`,
  `prospect.scored`, `prospect.reviewed`, `prospect.completed`. (`run.started`/`run.completed`/
  `plan.created` are not yet emitted — natural Checkpoint C additions once the API wires a `Run`
  lifecycle around `execute_run`.)

**Repositories** (`apps/api/groundwork/repositories/`) — `plays.py`, `runs.py` (+ `sweep_interrupted()`
for the honest-crash-recovery sweep), `prospects.py` (`CompanyRepository` + `ProspectRepository`),
`prospect_data.py` (evidence/signals/scores/contacts/drafts/review results), `tasks.py` (`agent_tasks`
+ idempotency check), `events.py` (append-only `run_events`, `after_seq` query ready for Checkpoint
C's SSE replay).

**Fixtures** (`apps/api/groundwork/fixtures/demo_pack.yaml`) — 7 companies (6 required + the optional
Sable Compute, added since the six landed comfortably and all tests were green): Northwind Labs
(`PASS`, transient retry), Riverbend Analytics (`NEEDS_REVIEW`, ungrounded funding claim demoted),
Northwind Labs Inc. (`DUPLICATE`), Cobalt Retail Systems (`REJECTED`, hard disqualifier), Ferrous Grid
(`NEEDS_REVIEW`, contact `UNAVAILABLE` → personalization skipped), Quarry Systems (`FAILED`, retries
exhausted), Sable Compute (`PASS`). Every company has evidence only — no precomputed score or status
field anywhere in the YAML.

**Scripts** (`apps/api/groundwork/scripts/`) — `seed.py` (schema + fixture validation), `reset.py`
(wipe SQLite file incl. `-wal`/`-shm`, recreate schema), `run_demo.py` (the acceptance script: prints
the full execution trace and the computed status distribution). `Makefile`'s `seed`/`demo-reset` stubs
are now wired to these; added a `make demo` target for `run_demo.py`.

## Tests written and verified

All commands run from `apps/api/`. **40/40 passing** (`uv run pytest`, ~3–4s).

| File | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `test_health.py` | Checkpoint A health check | ✅ (1) |
| `test_dedupe.py` | domain normalization, legal-suffix stripping, key precedence | ✅ (5) |
| `test_grounding.py` | token overlap, grounded/ungrounded claims, cross-prospect citation rejection | ✅ (7) |
| `test_scoring.py` | weights sum to 1.0, full-evidence high score, hard disqualifier caps at 25, unsupported dimension contributes 0, same-input-same-score, confidence = coverage, industry/size boundary cases | ✅ (8) |
| `test_review.py` | all seven checks individually, hard→FAIL / soft→NEEDS_REVIEW / clean→PASS, unverified contact + email is a hard fail, hard outranks soft | ✅ (11) |
| `test_fixture_provenance.py` | no fixture source is a URL, every fixture row has title/claim/snippet, the model validator rejects a fake URL on `DEMO_FIXTURE` *and* `LLM_INFERENCE`, and requires one on `LIVE_FETCH` | ✅ (6) |
| **`test_isolation.py`** | **two confusable prospects, unique canary tokens, run through the real engine concurrently; asserts zero cross-contamination in evidence, signals, score explanation and outreach** | ✅ (1) |
| `test_run_integration.py` | full 7-prospect headless run: exact status distribution, ≥1 retry recorded, Quarry's research retries genuinely exhausted, Northwind's score deterministic and reproducible, duplicate correctly links `duplicate_of`, `run_events` present and strictly ordered | ✅ (1) |

**Headless demo verification** (`make demo-reset && make demo`, seed=42):

```
DUPLICATE: 1   FAILED: 1   NEEDS_REVIEW: 2   PASS: 2   REJECTED: 1
run status: PARTIAL
retries recorded: 3
```

Northwind Labs (PASS, score 92) retried once on research (`ProviderTimeout` → succeeded on attempt 2).
Quarry Systems (FAILED) exhausted all 3 research attempts (`ProviderUnavailable`) without affecting
any sibling prospect. Confirmed reproducible across repeated `make demo-reset && make demo` runs.
**No outcome is hardcoded** — every status above is the runner's own `_derive_final_status()` reading
`ctx.score.disqualified` and `ctx.review.verdict`, both computed from fixture evidence at run time.

## Known issues / deviations from plan

- **`stable_seed()` instead of `hash()`** for seeded jitter (see `providers/base.py`) — Python's
  builtin `hash()` on strings is randomized per process, so the plan's illustrative
  `random.Random(hash((run_id, prospect_id, step_name)))` would not actually reproduce across runs.
  Using a sha256-based digest instead so `--seed` on `run_demo.py` is genuinely replayable.
- **`SearchProvider.fetch_sources` takes an extra `ctx_key` parameter** beyond the plan's §11
  Protocol sketch, needed to scope scripted-failure attempt counts and jitter per `(run_id,
  prospect_id, step)` rather than per-company-globally. `LLMProvider.structured` already had
  `ctx_key` in the plan, so this just makes both Protocol methods consistent.
- **No separate `SignalExtractionOutput` LLM call.** The plan describes signal detection as Hybrid
  (LLM proposes, deterministic verifier confirms); implemented as: Research's LLM call *is* the
  "propose" half (it returns claim text per fact), and `engine/steps/signals.py` is the deterministic
  verifier, with no second LLM round-trip. Keeps the engine smaller without weakening the
  hybrid-verification claim — the demotion-on-ungrounded-claim mechanism is real and is what makes
  Riverbend Analytics land `NEEDS_REVIEW` from actual token-overlap failure, not a scripted flag.
  `models/llm_io.py` documents this in `ResearchExtractionOutput`'s docstring.
- **`domain/scoring.py`'s `explanation` field is filled by a real (demo) LLM call**, wired in
  `engine/steps/score.py`, honoring the "LLM writes prose from the numbers, never changes them" claim
  — `ScoreExplanationOutput` only carries a string, and the envelope's metadata carries only the
  already-computed `overall`/`top_dimensions`, so the model has no numbers to alter even if it tried.
- **Objective Parser LLM agent (§8) is not built.** It's a New Play *screen* concern (Checkpoint D);
  `run_demo.py` and `seed.py` load the fixture pack's own authored `PlaySpec` directly, same as the
  demo pipeline will eventually receive from the parser. No engine code depends on it existing yet.
- **Core engine machinery is ~484 LOC** (`context.py` + `step.py` + `pipeline.py` + `runner.py`,
  including docstrings), slightly over the "~400 LOC" figure in §30/§33. That figure's stated purpose
  — preventing a generic DAG/plugin framework — was preserved: this is a fixed 7-step list, one retry
  wrapper, and one semaphore-bounded fan-out, not a framework. Not considered worth trimming further
  at the cost of the documentation that makes this reviewable without conversation history.
- **`run.started`/`run.completed`/`plan.created` events are not emitted yet** — `execute_run()` doesn't
  wrap a full `Run` lifecycle event sequence yet (only per-prospect events). Natural to add in
  Checkpoint C when the API wraps `execute_run` in a request/response cycle.
- Sable Compute (7th, optional fixture) was added per the plan's explicit allowance ("if six are
  comfortably complete and cost nothing to extend"); Halden Systems (the 8th, also optional) was not
  added — not required for the acceptance distribution and the checkpoint clock took priority.
- Nothing about Checkpoint A is affected or altered.

---

## Next task

**Checkpoint C — API / SSE** (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §30, budget 40m). Wire
`api/routers/{plays,runs,prospects,evaluation,settings}.py` around the existing `PlayRepository` /
`execute_run` / repositories, add the `run_events` SSE generator with `after_seq` replay-then-tail and
a heartbeat, and the `INTERRUPTED` sweep on startup (the repository method `RunRepository
.sweep_interrupted()` already exists — call it from `main.py`'s lifespan). Acceptance: curl a play →
run → `curl -N .../events?after_seq=0` shows staggered interleaved per-prospect frames; reconnect with
the last `seq` loses nothing; `GET /prospects/{id}` returns the full aggregate; `GET
/runs/{id}/evaluation` returns computed metrics. **Do not build any React until SSE is verified from
curl. No cancel endpoint.**

---

## Do not touch (finished areas)

- Everything under **Known issues / deviations** above — those are deliberate, not oversights.
- `apps/api/groundwork/domain/*.py` — pure, unit-tested, and the four modules the project's whole
  audit-chain story rests on. Changing scoring weights/formulas or review check semantics is a scope
  decision — surface it, don't silently drift.
- `apps/api/groundwork/engine/{context,step,pipeline,runner}.py` — the isolation/concurrency/retry
  machinery. Extend via new steps or repositories, not by restructuring the fan-out or replacing
  `gather(return_exceptions=True)`.
- `apps/api/groundwork/fixtures/demo_pack.yaml` — the acceptance distribution
  (`test_run_integration.py`) is keyed to this exact evidence. Editing a company's evidence can change
  its computed outcome; re-run `make test` and `make demo` after any edit here.
- `apps/api/groundwork/models/schemas.py`'s `Evidence._no_fake_sources` validator and
  `tests/test_fixture_provenance.py` — the provenance invariant. Do not weaken either without
  explicit approval.
- Checkpoint A's `do not touch` list (`main.py`/`config.py`/`db.py`'s pre-existing shape, `apps/web/`)
  still applies; `config.py`/`db.py` grew as anticipated (WAL pragma already existed from Checkpoint A
  and is unchanged; added `create_all()`/`drop_all()` only).
